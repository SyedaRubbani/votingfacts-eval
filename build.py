"""Build/validate the VotingFacts dataset: check the questions, ground truth, and cached answers
line up, and print the dataset shape. Run this before scoring to confirm the data is consistent.

The dataset is two files under data/:
  data/questions.jsonl    one rendered voter question per row, joined to its reference fact
  data/ground-truth.csv   the verified facts (one row per fact), each carrying its own citation

and the cached system-under-test answers under results/:
  results/answers.jsonl   one answer per (question x model), already collected (web search on)

Run:  uv run build.py
